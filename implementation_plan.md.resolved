# Vị Quê - Local Specialty Marketplace Implementation Plan

This project will build "Vị Quê", a full-stack local specialty marketplace using a Golang (Gin + GORM) MVC backend and a Next.js (App Router + Tailwind) frontend.

## User Review Required

Please review the proposed architecture and execution order. Let me know if you would like any adjustments to the approach or data models before I begin generating the files.

## Proposed Changes

### Backend Structure
- We will initialize a Go module `backend` and create the MVC directories (`models`, `controllers`, `services`, `repositories`, `middleware`, `routes`, `utils`, `dto`).
- Database models will use GORM with PostgreSQL.
- Auth uses JWT and bcrypt.
- Rate limiting and security headers will be added as Gin middleware.

### Frontend Structure
- We will initialize a Next.js 14 project using `npx create-next-app@latest`.
- UI will be built with Tailwind CSS, `shadcn/ui`, and Framer Motion.
- State management via Zustand, API calls via Axios + SWR.

### Execution Order
1. **Setup**: Generate folder structure, `go.mod`, and Next.js foundation.
2. **Backend Core**: Connect to DB (`gorm`), define all `models/*.go`, create seeding script.
3. **Backend Auth**: Build `auth_service.go`, `auth_controller.go`, `jwt_util.go`, and test endpoints.
4. **Backend Modules**: Add products, categories, orders, and reviews with complete CRUD and RBAC.
5. **Frontend Core**: Install dependencies, setup layout, and routing.
6. **Frontend Features**: Build Homepage, Auth, Products, Cart, Dashboards (Seller/Admin).
7. **Deployment & Docs**: Add `docker-compose.yml`, `README.md`, and Postman collection.

## Verification Plan

### Automated Tests
- The backend API endpoints will be tested via code to ensure proper responses.
- Application components will be verified to execute without fatal errors.

### Manual Verification
- We will use Docker Compose to start the full stack.
- We will verify that we can browse the frontend, login, and purchase an item.
